Aquisition, Calibration and Processing of low SNR astronomical imaging data under light polluted skies to improve final SNR using the following software programs
1. deepskystacker for calibration, stacking and filtering out bad sub exposures
2. siriL for image processing such as Histogram stretch, Colour Calibration, Background Extraction, Star reduction
3. graXpert for noise reduction
4. Astrometry for Validation of deep sky objects and field of view 
5. photons to photos for camera characteristics like input refererred read noise
